[00:15.46] Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
[00:19.27] Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
[00:22.51] I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
[00:26.89] I'm star walkin'
[00:34.89] 
[00:29.88] Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'

[00:41.92] On the mission to get high up
[00:46.19] I know that I'ma die reachin' for a life that
[00:48.66] I don't really need at all
[00:50.63] Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise
[00:53.44] You should never take advice from somebody that ain't try
[01:21.94] 
[00:57.25] They said I wouldn't make it out alive
[01:00.71] They told me I would never see the rise
[01:04.11] That's why I gotta get 'em every time
[01:07.94] Gotta watch 'em bleed too

[01:33.83] I'm star walkin'
[01:41.83] 
[01:37.71] Been that - since I came out my mama (woo)
[01:41.64] Thankin' God daddy never wore a - (woo)
[01:44.48] Prove 'em wrong every time 'til it's normal
[01:47.80] Why worship legends when you know that you can join 'em? (Join 'em)
[02:21.30] 
[01:51.39] Th-these demons don't like me, they don't like me
[01:53.68] Likely, they wanna fight me
[01:56.45] Come on, try it out, try me
[01:58.85] They put me down, but I never cried out, "Why me?"
[02:01.60] Word from the wise, don't put worth inside somebody that ain't try
[02:34.60] 
[02:05.04] They said I wouldn't make it out alive
[02:09.01] They told me I would never see the rise
[02:13.10] That's why I gotta get 'em every time
[02:16.85] Gotta watch 'em bleed too

[02:42.65] I'm star walkin'
[02:50.65] 
[02:49.39] (Star walkin')
[02:56.39] 
[02:55.19] Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
[03:00.56] Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
